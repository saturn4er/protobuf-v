# Vlang-Protobuf Library

Welcome to the Vlang-Protobuf Library! This is a work in progress project that aims to provide a simple and efficient way to work with Protocol Buffers (protobuf) in Vlang.

## What is Protocol Buffers?
[Documentation](https://protobuf.dev/overview/)

Protocol buffers provide a language-neutral, platform-neutral, extensible mechanism for serializing structured data in a forward-compatible and backward-compatible way. It’s like JSON, except it’s smaller and faster, and it generates native language bindings. You define how you want your data to be structured once, then you can use special generated source code to easily write and read your structured data to and from a variety of data streams and using a variety of languages.
